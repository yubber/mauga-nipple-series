mauga nipple pve: please edit [pvnip.opy](https://github.com/yubber/mauga-nipple-series/blob/main/pvnip.opy)



the code in this repository is **not** workshop code. to compile this to workshop code, you can send me the edited file, or:

1. go to https://zezombye.github.io/overpy/demo

2. paste all the code in the middle box (Overpy text)

3. select the language of your *overwatch installation* in the dropdown

4. copy the contents of "compiled text".

5. you can now paste in the code (**not** an import code. on the same screen, click the orange paste icon instead.)

you can upload the code under your account, or ask me to upload it.

the former is easier for you to update, the latter is easier for me to update whenever i add features to mauga nipple pve.

thank you for translating!
